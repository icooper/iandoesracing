I'm planning on doing this regardless of outside financial support, so any contributions received are above and beyond the basic need. That said, any help along the way is very much appreciated as it reduces the financial burden on myself and my family.

Although the entry fee for Sandblast is relatively low, that's only a small part of the expense of participating in an event like this. Even just a few dollars helps offset the cost of gas, tires, and food.
