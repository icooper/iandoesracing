I'm planning on doing this regardless of outside financial support, so any contributions received are above and beyond the basic need. That said, any help along the way is very much appreciated as it reduces the financial burden on myself and my family.

Currently, I'm in the process of sourcing:

* motocross-style boots
* pressure suit and neck restraint
* hydration solution
* lodging for 3 nights near Cheraw

If you can help me with a deal on one of the above needs, please [send me an email](mailto:ian@does.racing) so we can talk.

Alternatively, if you would like to help out with a few dollars for gas, tires, and food, please use the button below.
