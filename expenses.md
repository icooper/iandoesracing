  Motorcycle racing isn't cheap.
</p>

In the interest of full transparency, here's a tally of the cost involved so far. I've grouped the expenses into several categories:
* __Entry__: entry and administrative fees
* __Racer__: things for me
* __Vehicle__: things for the bike
* __Cosmetic__: things related to making the bike look good
* __Travel__: things related to getting to and from the event

Keep in mind, as I have been riding for years, I already have a lot of motorcycle gear. Don't consider this an exhaustive list of what's needed to participate in an event like this. Most items are linked to a relevant blog post.

I'm planning on doing this regardless of outside financial support, so any contributions received are above and beyond the basic need. That said, any help along the way is very much appreciated as it reduces the financial burden on myself and my family.

Although the entry fee for Sandblast is relatively low, that's only a small part of the expense of participating in an event like this. Even just a few dollars helps offset the cost of gas, tires, and food.
