  What have I gotten myself into?
</p>

I grew up riding a bicycle as a child. I vividly remember the first day I got my own 10-speed mountain bike: it didn't go well. I ran into a big dog and went over the bars into the ditch on the side of the road.

Fortunately, things have improved since then. I frequently rode my bike to school, and in the summer would ride all over to meet up with my friends. But after high school, I stopped riding regularly.

Fast forward 18 years: last June my wife and I decided to take up mountain biking. Living in Grand Junction, Colorado, there are many trails nearby, so it's easy to get out a few times a week and work up a sweat. Both my fitness level and bike handling have improved a lot---easy when you start from zero---and I figured it was time to set a goal.

On May 9th, 2020, I'll be competing in the [Desert RATS Classic](https://geminiadventures.com/desert-rats-mtb/) mountain bike race. It's a 50 kilometer (31-mile) course run on some local roads and trails that involves a lot of climbing. There's a 5-hour cutoff, so I'll need to average about 6.2 mph to finish.

Over the next few months, I'll be posting about my bike setup, my training and fitness, and fun rides.
