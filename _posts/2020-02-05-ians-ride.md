title: What am I riding?

I purchased this Trek Marlin---an entry-level hardtail mountain bike---from my local bike shop back in 2013. A few years back, I replaced the flat handlebars with a cheap riser bar, and the long original stem with a short stem in order to make the bike more comfortable for me to ride around town.

Since starting to ride regularly again last summer, I've replaced just about all of the components on the bike, upgrading to modern mountain bike components---the only original part left is the frame. With a set of relatively skinny (42mm) gravel tires currently mounted on the wheels, I've mostly been riding this on the roads and bike paths this winter.

I've stripped the bike down to the frame to give everything a good clean and inspection. Over the next two weeks, I'll be building it back up to the configuration that I'll use for the [Desert RATS Classic mountain bike race](https://geminiadventures.com/desert-rats-mtb/). During the process, I'll post about how the bike is put together and which components I've chosen and why.
