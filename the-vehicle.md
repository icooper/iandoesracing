I rode a 2009 KTM 505 XC-F for the 2019 Sandblast Rally. This bike was modified with a frame-mounted nav tower and fairing that was originally made by [@motominded](https://www.instagram.com/motominded/) for [Neduro's 2012 Dakar entry](https://advrider.com/f/threads/707131/). Before I purchased the bike, it had also been raced by Ned in the [2013 Touareg Rally](https://advrider.com/f/threads/862074/) and the 2013 [Baja Rally](https://www.bajarallymoto.com/), so if I didn't make it to the finish, it wasn't because of the bike!
