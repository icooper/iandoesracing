I'll be riding a 2009 KTM 505 XC-F for the 2019 Sandblast Rally. This bike has been modified with a frame-mounted nav tower and fairing that was originally made by [@motominded](https://www.instagram.com/motominded/) for [Neduro's 2012 Dakar entry](https://advrider.com/f/threads/707131/). Before I purchased the bike, it had also been raced by Ned in the [2013 Touareg Rally](https://advrider.com/f/threads/862074/) and the 2013 [Baja Rally](https://www.bajarallymoto.com/), so if I don't make it to the finish, it's not because of the bike!

## Bike Prep

* [Getting Legal]({% link _posts/2018-12-31-getting-legal.md %}): inspection, insurance, and state registration

As I post additional entries about bike preparation, I'll add them to the list above.

[Continue to follow my journey](/) as a first-time competitor in the 2019 Sandblast Rally. I'll talk about the process of entering as a first-time competitor, preparing myself and the bike, and how it all turns out in the end!
